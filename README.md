# MusicPlayer
A .wav and .mp3 player that I have been working on, very simple.

Makes use of the PortAudio sound library.
It now has a browse function to look for songs in file explorer.
Some verions of wave and mp3 files don't work. Will figure out why.

"something.h" is a header file that contains the wave file header struct.
