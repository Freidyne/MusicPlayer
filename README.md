# MusicPlayer
A .wav and .mp3 player that I have been working on, very simple.

Makes use of the PortAudio sound library.
At the moment it can only play a song from a hard-coded string within the main.cpp file.
I'm going to add a song selector menu and maybe a music library finder.

"something.h" is a header that contains the wave file header struct.
